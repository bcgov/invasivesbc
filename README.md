[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=bcgov_invasivesbc&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=bcgov_invasivesbc) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/bcgov/invasivesbc/branch/dev/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/bcgov/invasivesbc)

## Introduction

Invasive species are non-native plants and animals whose introduction and spread in British Columbia cause significant economic, social or environmental damage. This application tracks the observation, treatment, and monitoring of invasive species in the Province of British Columbia.

This project is part of the Species and Ecosystems Information System Modernization (SEISM) program.

## Project Status

This application is in active development and has not yet been released.

## Audience

Anyone with a valid IDIR or BCeID login may access the application to view data that is being tracked.

In addition, the application is intended for use by:

* Surveyors who observe and record the absence, presence, and spread of invasive species

1. User roles and permissions management
1. Interactive maps displaying multiple data layers
1. Observations of invasive species absence/presence
1. Recommendations, planning, and application records of treatments
1. Monitoring of treatment outcomes
1. Query and export of data
1. Auditing and reports
1. Bulk data entry and mobile device data entry

## Documentation

## Requirements

We are using Visual Code for our IDE due to the excellent integration of our tolls and utilities.

### Development

Ionic/React

```
npm install -g @ionic/cli native-run cordova-res
```

The ideal multi-platform supporting machine is the Mac, But Windows and Linus work very well for Web and Android as well.

### Android Development

Install AndroidStudio and the Android SDK

### IOS Development

On MacOS: Install xCode


## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository to your own machine and follow instructions below.

## Run the app locally (web)

In the app directory:

```
npm install

ionic serve
```

## Run the app on mobile

### Android

On MacOS, Windows or Linux, in the app directory:

1. `npm install`
2. `ionic build`
3. `ionic cap add android` (Only the first time, does not need to be repeated after)
4. `ionic cap copy`
5. `ionic cap sync`
6. `npx cap open Android`

Android Studio will open and, after a short delay, will allow you to run the application in the simulator.


### IOS

On MacOS, in the app directory:

1. `npm install`
2. `ionic build`
3. `ionic cap add android` (Only the first time, does not need to be repeated after)
