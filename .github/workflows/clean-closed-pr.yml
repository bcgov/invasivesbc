# Clean out the deployment artifacts when a PR is closed (but not merged).
# This deletes the PR artifacts created by the deploy-pr workflow.

# This workflow only runs if the PR has the 'PR-DEPLOY' label when it is first created.
# If the label is added after the PR has been opened, you will need to push a change to the PR to re-trigger the workflow.
# Manually re-running the workflow (via the 're-run jobs' button) won't work, as the git context won't have updated and the new label and/or title won't be present.
